Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and 
    right as far as it can).
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned 
    relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
